This repository contains 2 libraries:
- linker_lua.dll
- RemoteLogger.dll

linker_lua.dll restores Lua support to the Black Ops III modtools linker.

RemoteLogger.dll is loaded by "linker_modtools.exe", and RemoteLogger.dll in
turn loads linker_lua.dll.

To build these libraries, run "make". This will first download "libhksc" and
build it, then build the libraries.

Finally, run "make install" to install the built libraries to the same
directory as "linker_modtools.exe".

This software uses "libhksc" as its Lua compiler, which supports the Call of
Duty Havok Script extensions (e.g. bitwise operators, separate debug info,
function name hashes, etc.). It can be found here:
