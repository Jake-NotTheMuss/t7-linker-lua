README for t7-linker-lua

linker_lua.dll restores Lua support to the Black Ops III modtools
linker.

'make' will first download "libhksc" and build it, then build the
linker_lua.dll.

'make install' will install the DLL and add 'linker,linker_lua.dll' to
ta_tools_config.csv
(https://github.com/Jake-NotTheMuss/ta_tools_config.git).

This software uses "libhksc" as its Lua compiler, which supports the
Call of Duty Havok Script extensions (e.g. bitwise operators, separate
debug info, function name hashes, etc.). It can be found here:
